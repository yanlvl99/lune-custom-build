=== FFI Zero-Copy Test ===

1. Arena Allocation:
  Created arena, id: 1
  Allocated 256 bytes, addr: 2108238606208
  isManaged: true
  isNull: false
  Allocated i32[10], addr: 2108238790272
  Arena total allocated: 296
  Arena allocation count: 2

2. Raw Pointer Arithmetic:
  raw addr: 2108238606208
  raw + 10: 2108238606218 (diff: 10 bytes)
  raw + 20: 2108238606228 (diff: 20 bytes)

3. Direct Read/Write:
  Wrote i32=42 at offset 0
  Wrote i32=100 at offset 4
  Wrote f64=3.14159 at offset 8
  Read at 0: 42
  Read at 4: 100
  Read at 8: 3.14159

4. Typed Pointer (cast and indexing):
  Cast to TypedPointer<i32>, stride: 4
  Wrote ints[0]=111, ints[1]=222, ints[2]=333
  ints[0]: 111
  ints[1]: 222
  ints[2]: 333
  ints + 2: addr diff = 8 bytes (2 * 4)

5. Struct Definition:
  Created PlayerDef
  size: 20
  alignment: 4
  fieldCount: 5
  offsetOf('x'): 0
  offsetOf('y'): 4
  offsetOf('health'): 12

6. Struct View:
  Set player.x=10.5, y=20.3, z=-5.0, health=100, mana=50
  player.x: 10.5
  player.y: 20.299999237060547
  player.z: -5
  player.health: 100
  player.mana: 50

7. Bulk Operations (copy/fill):
  Filled src with 0xAB
  Copied 64 bytes from src to dst
  src[0]: 171 (0xAB)
  dst[0]: 171 (0xAB)

8. Arena Reset:
  Before reset - totalAllocated: 444
  After reset - totalAllocated: 0
  allocationCount: 0
